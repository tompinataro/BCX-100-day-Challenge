# Body Confidence 100-day Challenge
The BCX Challenge is more than a 100-day journey; it’s a commitment to yourself, your growth, and your confidence. BCX is about building intentional habits that align with your values and creating a lifestyle that reflects the best version of you. Every step you take is an opportunity to embrace your unique strength, cultivate balance, and thrive with the support of a like-minded community.
In BCX, you’ll master two powerful phases: Build and Consistency. Each step builds on the last, encouraging progress over perfection and helping you cultivate habits that last.

## Phase 1: Build (50 Days)
This phase is all about laying a strong foundation through intentional habits. You’ll focus on mastering one habit at a time, each for 10 consecutive days, before moving to the next. If you miss a day, you’ll reset that step, showing resilience and embracing ownership of your journey.
### Hydrate: 
Commit to drinking 1 gallon of water daily to refresh your body and boost your energy.
### Grow: 
Add 15 minutes of personal development daily to strengthen your mindset and unlock new perspectives.
### Move: 
Stay active with 10,000 steps daily (and one rest day each week), embracing movement as a celebration of your strength.
### Focus: 
Dedicate 5 minutes to guided meditation daily, grounding yourself with compassion and clarity.
### Nourish: 
Follow a meal plan that supports your goals, fueling your body with balance and intention. No alcohol.  No refined sugar. Teach Plan Twice Method.
You’ll progress step by step, cultivating consistency and confidence as you go. Each day is a chance to show up for yourself and lean into your inner strength.

## Phase 2: Consistency (50 Days)
Once you’ve built your foundation, it’s time to strengthen and sustain it. In the Consistency Phase, you’ll continue all the habits from Phase 1 while incorporating an additional practice that emphasizes balance and mindfulness:
### Unplug and Done: 
Unplug = When you’re evening starts your phone use stops.  
Done = After dinner, no snacking.  Use this time to connect, reflect, and create harmony in your life.
This phase celebrates your resilience and vibrancy as you continue showing up for yourself every day. With the support of the BCX community, you’ll thrive in your unique journey while uplifting others on theirs.

# BCX Challenge FAQ
What does BCX stand for?
BCX stands for Build Confidence 100, a 100-day challenge designed to help you cultivate intentional habits, develop consistency, and build a balanced, vibrant lifestyle.

How long is the challenge?
The challenge is 100 days, provided you complete it without missing any days. If you miss a day, you restart that specific step until you complete 10 consecutive days.
If you fail a single step three times in a row, you must restart from Day 1 of that step. This rule is designed to help you create a more solid foundation and avoid intentionally failing as a way to take a break. Sometimes, slowing down is necessary to build lasting success.

Can I modify the steps?
No. The challenge is designed to be followed exactly as written. No modifications and no compromises.
If you feel you need to modify the challenge, it’s a sign that this challenge may not be right for you. Body Confidence likely has another product that aligns better with your current needs. This challenge is about building discipline, and modifications dilute that purpose.

Can men participate?
Yes, anyone can do the BCX Challenge, but the community group is exclusively for women.

What counts toward the water requirement in Step 1 (Hydrate)?
Your water must be free of caffeine and chemicals. You can add clean flavor drops, electrolytes, or infuse it with fruit or herbs.

What counts as personal development in Step 2 (Grow)?
Personal development involves 15 minutes of dedicated time learning something new. Acceptable options include podcasts, audiobooks, or books. Reflection or journaling doesn’t count for this step.

How do I track my 10,000 steps for Step 3 (Move)?
You must use your own method of step tracking, such as a fitness tracker or app, to ensure you meet the goal.

What does "Unplug and Done" mean in Phase 2?
The purpose of this step is to disconnect from distractions and focus on being present with the people and environment around you.
•	After dinner, put your phone in a dedicated spot to avoid constant checking.
•	No social media, mindless scrolling, and unnecessary notifications.
•	Phone is access point to so many things. No phone use. Use your discretion.  Do not aimlessly scroll. 
Let your "done" time reflect mindfulness and intentionality. No late night snacking. 

What if I don’t eat dinner at a typical time?
If you have an unconventional schedule (e.g., working night shifts), consider your "dinner" as the time when you eat your last meal of the day. It’s recommended that this be at least three hours before bedtime to help with digestion and overall wellness.

What happens if I miss a day?
If you miss a day in a step, you must restart that specific step until you successfully complete it for 10 consecutive days. If you fail the same step three times, you restart the entire challenge from Hydrate Day 1.

Can I pause the challenge if I’m sick or on vacation?
No. This is a challenge, and it’s designed to be completed regardless of your circumstances. The steps are achievable even while traveling or adapting to life’s challenges.

Can I do the challenge if I’m pregnant or postpartum?
Yes, but you should consult your doctor before starting the challenge to ensure it aligns with your health needs and current condition.

Do I need a fitness tracker for Step 3 (Move)?
Yes, you need a reliable way to track your steps to ensure you’re meeting the daily goal of 10,000 steps.

What kind of results can I expect from the BCX Challenge?
The true results of this challenge are confidence gained through follow-through. It’s not a weight loss challenge, but a discipline-building experience that helps you develop habits, resilience, and self-belief.
